# E-Commerce Platform Backend (Golang + PostgreSQL + JWT)

This is the backend service for an **E-Commerce Platform**, built with **Golang**, **Gin**, **PostgreSQL**, and **JWT authentication**.  
It provides APIs for user authentication, product management, and order handling.  

The project is still under development, with the goal of creating a scalable backend that can support user accounts, browsing products, managing carts, placing orders, and handling payments.

‚ö° This intro makes it clear the backend is **for an e-commerce platform** and still a **work in progress**.  

Do you also want me to include a **sample `docker-compose.yml`** in the README so that new contributors can copy-paste and spin up the whole local environment instantly?
